Don't Stop;Fleetwood Mac;If you wake up and don't want to smile If it takes just a little while Open your eyes and look at the day You'll see things in a different way Don't stop thinking about tomorrow Don't stop, it'll soon be here It'll be here better than before Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone Why not think about times to come? And not about the things that you've done? If your life was bad to you Just think what tomorrow will do Don't stop thinking about tomorrow Don't stop, it'll soon be here It'll be here better than before Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone All I want is to see you smile If it takes just a little while I knokw you don't believe that it's true I never meant any harm to you Don't stop thinking about tomorrow Don't stop, it'll soon be here It'll be here better than before Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone Don't stop thinking about tomorrow Don't stop, it'll soon be here It'll be here better than before Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone Don't you look back Don't you look back Don't you look back Don't you look back
